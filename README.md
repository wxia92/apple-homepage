Apple Homepage Clone by William Xia

Description: 
A clone of the (old) apple homepage with a gradient background for the header. The main background image and the four subheader panel images were taken directly from the original website, but the rest of the page was made from scratch.

What I Learned:
To create the header I used an unordered list with a right border on all of the elements except the last. The background gradient was made by using a stop in the middle with a dark black color, and a white color at the bottom of the element. The four panel images at the bottom were also made using an unordered list. The footer was created with two containers and floated left and right, respectively.
